**Mint** is a client-side Bedwars resource tracker. It tracks how many resources you have in your inventory and in your Ender Chest. The mod is focused around hypixel, but should work fine for most other servers aswell.

I made thie because the alternatives have _meh_ HUDs or don't support hypixel's new punch to deposit feature.

If you run into issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/bewf/Mint/issues).
