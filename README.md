**Mint** is a client-side Bedwars resource tracker for Minecraft.

It tracks how many resources you have in your inventory and in your Ender Chest. 

I made alternatives have a _meh_ HUD, and don't support hypixel's new punch to deposit feature.

If you run into issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/bewf/Mint/issues).
